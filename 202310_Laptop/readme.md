# Background

I have an old laptop that I exchange from my brother. I gave him M1 macbook air for gift as he became an attorney and I asked him to his older laptop, samsun 360 pen.

# Problem

But the laptop is so hot when I turned on and it's battery is dry out so quickly. I thought this cannot be true

## Suspected problems

### Structure problem

samsung don't care about low-voltage stuff so it originally so hot like this. if this is true, nothing I can do

### Battery problem

as battery is old and used a lot, I thought this can be a problem

### System might by harmed

I thought it can be a problem if heat-delivering system is malfunctioned, but, first I put it away since this problem can only figured out by open the stomach of the laptop

# Methods

## Service Center

I really enjoy fixing or change stuff but extremely expensive electronics or high-voltage stuff is what I don't want to try. So I go the nearby Samsung service center for figure out the battery problem. But it turns out to be that the battery is not the problem. So I have to open the stomach of brother's old friend

## Surgery

I open up the belly of the laptop and trying to figure out the problem. Then I saw something suspicious things in the laptop

The heat transfer from cpu to main copper system is harmed. So I paste thermal grease for easier heat transfer and make sure that thw two parts attach tightly.
