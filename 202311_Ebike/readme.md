```

My poor bike... she take my girlfriend whereever she wants... now she died because of 40 degree Seoul's hell burning temperature and one of stockpiled battery in China's warehouse...

## Confirmed Problem

### Battery

I first checked the battery and VOILA!!! Battery billow like Galaxy note 7!!! I instantly dumped it and order a new battery that has higher Ah(previous 12 --> 20) and much smaller and lighter one.

### Brake

I saw that brake system is malfunctioned. at the fist time but I ignore the problem it might halter the acceleration system but it did not harm the brake system.

## Suspected Problems

### Controller

Controller might be the reason for the non-acceleration system. So I need to test when new battery is arrived

# How I fix the problem

## Battery

This one is very easy, I first order new battery with 48V 20Ah battery in Aliexpress and wait 1 month to arrival. As new one is a quite small compared to previous one, So I have to fill the battery case with styrofoam and etc. But the output voltage shows only 32V and I first thought that they sent to me the wrong battery but it turns out that it has low power ;; So I charged it and found it can make 52V. I thought 48V battery's minimum voltage is like 40~44 but I'm wrong

## Brake

First, I disassemble rear part of the bike into ashes including brake system. I found out that brake system is quite unique that it did not use brake pad to stop the bike, it use like big circle-shaped system.

 it is so hard to figure out how it works and how can I fix the problem but I did it!!!

### Controller

I first thought that it might be the problem but thanks to the colleague Jearci(Ph.D), I checked that it works perfectly after I charged the battery
